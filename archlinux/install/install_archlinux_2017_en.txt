Here is a list of what I do in the video:

(i) Make some space for Arch Linux in Windows
(ii) Make a bootable installation media for Arch Linux (Not covered in this tutorial)
(iii) Attach it to your computer
(iv) Shutdown Windows after disabling fast shutdown. And use the command shutdown -s -t 0 to do so.
(v) Boot into Arch Linux Installation media in UEFI Mode.
(vi) Create two partitions in that empty space: (a) Swap (b) Root Partition

gdisk /dev/sda

n #Wanna create new partition!

#Hit enter, don't care about partition number
#Hit enter, automatically first sector will be starting of unallocated space

+2GB #Specify the size of the swap partition
8200 #Hex code for the Linux Swap partition.

w #Write changes to disk
Y #Confirm!

Type gdisk -l /dev/sda to find out the partition number of the swap partition. In my case, it is 5.

mkswap -L "Linux Swap" /dev/sda5 #Linux Swap is the label
swapon /dev/sda5 #Turn on swap!

free -m #Last line will confirm whether swap space has been turned on or not.

#Time to create partition in which Arch will be installed.

gdisk /dev/sda
n #Wanna create new partition!

#Hit enter, don't care about partition number
#Hit enter, automatically first sector will be starting of unallocated space
#Hit enter, automatically rest of the unallocated space will be filled
#Hit enter, default Hex code for the Linux Partition.

w #Write changes to disk
Y #Confirm!

(vii) Format the partition into filesystems.

Type gdisk -l /dev/sda to find out the partition number of the newly created partition. In my case, it is 6.

mkfs.ext4 -L "Arch Linux" /dev/sda6 #Format the new partition with ext4 file system.

(viii) Mount the partition in which Arch Linux files will be present to /mnt

mount /dev/sda6 /mnt

(ix) Use pacstrap to initialize the Arch Installation

If you are behind a proxy server, type: 

export http_proxy=http://proxy_ip_or_domain:proxy_port
packstrap /mnt base

(x) Find and mount the efi partition to /mnt/boot/efi

mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi

#Type gdisk -l to figure out the partition number of the existing EFI partition. In my case, it is 2.

mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot/efi

(xi) Generate the fstab, so that required partitions are mounted on reboot.

genfstab -p /mnt | tee /mnt/etc/fstab

(xii) chroot into the arch installation.

arch-chroot /mnt

(xiii) Configure timezone, generate initial RAM disk.

#Chang password for root user

passwd
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Kolkata /etc/localtime
mkinitcpio -p linux

(xiv) Install the bootloader. I use grub.

pacman -Syu grub efibootmgr

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg #Generate initial grub config.
grub-install /dev/sda

(xv) Install the desktop environment, display manager, and vim and xterm.

packman -Syu gnome-desktop xterm vim gnome-display-manager
systemctl enable gdm #Start gdm on boot

(xvi) Create a new user and add him to the group wheel.

useradd -G wheel -s /bin/bash -m -c "Nehal J Wani" wani
passwd wani

(xvii) Reboot into Arch Linux

reboot

(xviii) Install os-prober. Regenerate grub configuration. Reboot.

pacman -Syu os-prober
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg 

Done! Now you can choose between Windows and Arch Linux at the start. Yay!
